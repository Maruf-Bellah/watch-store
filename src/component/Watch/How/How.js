                    Before creating client-side apps, many developers had to go through a lot of trouble, after which he developed it among Facebook developers. A document is accessed and manipulated by determining the logical structure and way of documenting it.) So, to speed it up, Feedback applies a virtual DOM which is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it has to read or write to the DOM, it will use its virtual representation. Virtual DOM will then try to find the most effective way to update the browser's DOM.
                    Unlike browser DOM components, responsive components are simpler objects and cheaper to create. Feedback DOM takes care to update the DOM to match the response components. This is because JavaScript is very fast and it is worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation.
                    Although Feedback was intended to be used in browsers, due to its design it can be used on servers with Node.js.
